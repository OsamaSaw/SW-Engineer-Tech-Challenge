# Floy Technical Challenge

## Questions

**1. What were the reasons for your choice of API/protocol/architectural style used for the client-server communication?**
I used Flask because I am familiar with it, its simple straight forward lib.
and used MongoDb because we are dealing with non-relational database, there is no relations between the tables 
so noSQL is the best option here.



**2.  As the client and server communicate over the internet in the real world, what measures would you take to secure the data transmission and how would you implement them?**
adding an SSH keys to control connections.
